# Valenbisi

In this project, *Valenbisi: an analysis on wheels*, an exhaustive analysis of the bike-sharing system in the city of Valencia has been carried out. This study has sought to understand the different aspects related to the use of this sustainable transport system:

- **Exploratory analysis of the data**. This analysis has mainly consisted of comparing how the central stations behave with respect to the peripheral ones.

- **Influence of meteorological variables on the use of Valenbisi bicycles**. Weather data, such as temperature, wind and precipitation, were collected and their relationship with bicycle usage patterns was evaluated.

- **Clustering techniques**. Valenbisi stations have been clustered according to their similarity in terms of usage patterns. This has allowed the identification of different clusters of stations with particular characteristics and needs, which can be used to improve the planning and distribution of bicycles in the city. Likewise, the incorporation of information about places of interest in the city of Valencia, such as universities, hospitals, beaches, commercial areas... has also been considered.

- **Predictive model**. Using the data collected, we tried to predict the future demand for Valenbisi. This model can be used to plan the distribution of bicycles and optimize the capacity of the stations according to the expected demand at different times and stations in the city.
